# Coral Reef Health Assessment Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a dashboard for assessing the health of coral reefs based on various environmental factors. The dashboard will provide visualizations of data related to benthic composition, water temperature, and water quality, and potentially include predictive models using machine learning techniques.

## Machine Learning Models
The project will start with traditional machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) for the predictive models. These models are well-suited for structured, tabular data and provide good interpretability. If deep learning models are to be explored, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a type of neural network, could be considered.

## Datasets
The project uses three datasets from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS):

1. **Benthic Data (all.reef.csv):** Contains information about the benthic composition at different reefs and depths.
2. **Satellite estimated Water Quality Data (bom.month.csv):** Contains satellite estimates of water quality parameters.
3. **In Situ Reef Temperature Data (waterTemp.csv):** Contains in situ measurements of water temperature at different reefs.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the main script to launch the dashboard.

## Dependencies
- Python

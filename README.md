# Coral Reef Health Assessment Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a dashboard for assessing the health of coral reefs based on various environmental factors. The dashboard will provide visualizations of data related to benthic composition, and will include predictive models using machine learning techniques to analyze and predict coral health.

## Key Components
- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Machine Learning Model Development
- Backend Development
- Frontend Development (React)
- Integration and Deployment

## Machine Learning Models
The project employs machine learning models to predict coral health based on environmental data. Models used include:

* **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method effective for handling structured, tabular data.
* **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM):** A powerful model known for its accuracy and efficiency in prediction tasks.
* **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** A type of recurrent neural network, useful for time-series data, which may be considered for future enhancements.

## Datasets
The project uses datasets from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS):

1. **Benthic Data (all.reef.csv):** Contains information about the benthic composition at different reefs and depths.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- React (for the dashboard)
- Node.js and npm

## Model Development
The model development involves training and tuning the following models:

* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
